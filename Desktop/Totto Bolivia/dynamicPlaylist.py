This script generates a dynamic playlist from mp3 music in one folder for the SHOUTcast transcoder. Additionally, jingles are supported.

To use the script, do the following
1. change baseDirectory, musicDirectory and jinglesDirectory according to your music folder structure
2. call it from a SHOUTcast transcoder playlist in the following way:
#!/usr/bin/python /home/shoutcast/sc_trans_folder/playlists/dynamicPlaylist.py
(see also http://wiki.winamp.com/wiki/SHOUTcast_DNAS_Transcoder_2#Remote_Applications)
3. If you change music in the music or the jingle folder delete the file called 'position' in the baseDirectory to trigger the generation of a new dynamic playlist. You can, however, also wait until all songs in the current playlist have been played and afterwards a new playlist will be generated automagically.

The script basically does the following:
1. It figures out if there is a position file in the baseDirectory. If this file is there it reads the position number in this file.
1b) If the position file is not there it generates one. position number will be set to 0. Additionally, buildAndSaveRandomPlaylist() looks for all mp3s in musicDirectory and creates a shuffled dynamic playlist from all mp3s. The playlist is stored in the file 'playlist' in baseDirectory.
2. printNextSongs() parses the generated playlist and looks for the next song at position. It then prints out that song to the SHOUTcast transcoder. Additionally, the next 'length' songs will be output to allow SHOUTcast transcoder to give this information to the SHOUTcast server in order to give this information to the yp. Although this functionality is includeed in SHOUTcast transcoder's documentation, SHOUTcast transcoder does currently not support this functionality (see http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?p=2896457&posted=1#post2896457) If the playlist has arrived at its end, a new playlist will be generated. If the next mp3 file from the current playlist has been removed from the filesystem, a new playlist will be generated.
